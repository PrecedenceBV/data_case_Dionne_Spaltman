write the code to open this csv as a pandas dataframe /Users/precedenceintern/PycharmProjects/data_case_Dionne_Spaltman/data-case/customer_data_comma.csv

What steps should I take to check the quality of the data?

ik wil mijn csv in excel opsplitsen via de komma's, hoe doe ik dat

what are possible steps to do in order to improve the data quality?

These are the things I found: # We have 1000 customers and we have 8 columns
    # there's barely any missing values, only missing values for name
    # Minimum age is 5, seems to be very low
    # Maximum age is 120, seems to way to high
    # Name's are not actual names, but just numbers
    # There's only 5 different states and 5 different cities

Can you help me write the code to split the rows with based on a ;. This is what I have so far import pandas as pd
    # Define the file path
    file_path = 'data-case/nps_scores.csv'
    # Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
    nps_scores = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    display(nps_scores)

I want to know which journey has the lower NPS score

journey_nps = nps_scores.groupby('journey')['nps_score'].mean().reset_index() I want to sort from lowest to highest

print all the unique values in the journey colomn

I have call_data and nps_data and both have a customer_ID . I want to merge on this, in order to see which journeys have longer waiting times etc.

I also want to look at the call_resolved column which is a yes or no answer. Per journey, look at what these stats are

I'm interested in the stats on order status which is a categorial variable. Can you add it?
    # Group by journey and calculate stats
    order_stats = merged_df_order.groupby('Journey_Type').agg(
        Order_Amount=('Order_Amount', 'mean'),
        avg_nps_score=('Recommendation_score', 'mean')
    ).reset_index()
    # Sort by pct_resolved descending (most resolved first)
    order_stats = order_stats.sort_values(by='avg_nps_score', ascending=False)
    display(order_stats)

can you add Payment_method and Product

Based on all of this, help me find creative solutions to improve the nps scores
